            <h1>Assignment 7 - Molding and Casting Finished, and Final Project Proposal</h1>
            
			<p> Assignment 7 was the Final Project!</p>
	

			<h3>The Final Project</h3>
			<p>As A reminder here is what I proposed in assignment 6</p>
			<p>"For my final project, I noticed that I had alot of issues throughout the quarter figuring out the right tolerances for parts that fit or snap together.</p>
			<p>In many cases, holes were too small, or the inserts too flimsy</p>
			<p>For my final project I will be exploring Snap together ball joints.</p> 
			<p>Ball joints allow a flexibility of movement, but without the right tolerances, it would be difficult to move, or fall right out</p>
			<p>This project will take some inspiration from the hoberman ball, and seek to create some sort of collapsable object from the ball joints.

				<h3>The Final Process</h3>
			<p> I began my project by looking for different ball and sockets that fit together. </p> 
			<p> I utilized models that others had created, and printed them all out (credits listed below)</p>
			<p> After printing them all out, I analyzed them on degree of motion and ease of snap fit. </p>
			<p> I then utilized the shape to create my own, Splitting the meshes, and joining them together to create my primary building piece.</p>
			<p> This piece was a ball on one end and a socket on the other, allowing multiple pieces to join together.</p>
			<p> I then created pieces that were all sockets and pieces that were all balls, to join the building blocks together at the top and the bottom.</p>
			<p> The most difficult part about this was figuring out the right dimensions to print at. </p>
			<p> For some reason when i brought the stl into my slicer, it would scale it up to the largest it could be within the slicer</p>
			<p> Thus it took quite a few test prints at different dimensions to make sure it would click together without falling apart all together, or breaking the socket.</p>
			<p> Below I put them all together and tested it by creating various shapes</p>
			<p> Even now, I notice that each piece is not exactly the same, my printer does not print the pieces perfectly enough, and more calibration may be needed.</p>
			<p> Especially with my project, even printing off by less than a mm caused the ball and socket joint to be loose and fall apart, or break the socket portion when trying to join them</p>
			<p> This quarter has been extremely fun, and I am excited to continue practicing 3D printing for various uses </p>

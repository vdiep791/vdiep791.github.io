            <h1>Assignment 6 - Molding and Casting Finished, and Final Project Proposal</h1>
            
			<p> Assignment 6 had us Finish our molds</p>
	
			<h3>Finishing the Mold</h3>
			<p>As you may recall, I decided to do a mold of a shot glass.</p>
			<p>I ran into some interesting issues that I had to work around. </p>
			<p>The first issue was not enough OOMOO, I underestimated the amount I would need for the mold</p>
			<p>Because of this, I had only ennough OOMOO to finish one half of the mold. Lucky for me The mold had 2 halves of the shot glass, so I just cut the mold in half</p>
			<p>Issue 2 once the mold had finished curing, I had trouble removing it because part of the mold was the interior of the shotglass which was a cave like feature in the mold.</p>
			<p>Thus the mold tore, and I had to bind ti together with some glue.</p>
			<p>Potentially this would work better as a 2 part mold, or I could try cutting the shot glass in the horizontal plane rather than the vertical plane. Inn that case the Shot glass should just be able to be pulled out</p>
			<p>Another issue I saw was if the sides of the mold got wet it would not form a proper seal, resulting in the water i was forming with to escape.</p>
			
			
			<h3>The Final Project</h3>
			<p>For my final project, I noticed that I had alot of issues throughout the quarter figuring out the right tolerances for parts that fit or snap together.</p>
			<p>In many cases, holes were too small, or the inserts too flimsy</p>
			<p>For my final project I will be exploring Snap together ball joints.</p> 
			<p>Ball joints allow a flexibility of movement, but without the right tolerances, it would be difficult to move, or fall right out</p>
			<p>This project will take some inspiration from the hoberman ball, and seek to create some sort of collapsable object from the ball joints.

            <h1>Assignment 3 - Getting Started with Grasshopper</h1>
			<p> Assignment 3 was a 2 part assignment, Making a construction kit, and Making a nested object </p>
			<h3> Making a construction kit</h3>
			<p>The Goal of this part of the assignment was to make clips that could clip Cardboard together. 
			<p>First try creating the clip I made a single clip in an H shape. when I sliced it and printed it, I had supports on, which caused the inside of the clip to have supports. </p>
			<p>Second try creating the clip I Flipped the clip on its side for printing, as well as making an array of them so I can print multiple at once easily. I printed these with a brim, and there was a little work to clean that away.</p>
			<p>Third attempt of the clip would be adding teeth to the end of each lip so that the can clamp down ad adjust for the height of the cardboard. </p>
			<p>Going foward changes I would make would be to adjust the height, and width of the H to find the perfect length and height for more varying sizes of cardboard. <p>
			<p>The main takeaway from this point was using how to program with grasshopper.

			<h3>Makng Nested Objects</h3>
			<p>For this part of the assignment we had to create a nested object.</p>
			<p>I was having alot of trouble with this part, but thanks to Jaspers tutorials, I was able to create them.
			<p>The Main takeaway from this project, was merging the two curves, and creating a list of lists.</p>

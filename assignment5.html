			<p> Assignment 5 had us Finish our Lamps and start on our Casting Molds</p>
	
			<h3>Finishing the Lamp</h3>
			<p>From Last time I just had a sketch of my design for my lamp.</p>
			<p>The first thing I did was create the Center cube in rhino. I used grasshopper to make sure the dimensions of the cube wit the circular center hole were per my design</p>
			<p>I then added tube extrusions for the peg holes. Which i then proceeded to use to cut out of the center cube using the -booleansplit- command<p>
			<p>I then designed the bottom cube, keeping the same model and renaming it. I deleted the Cube, but kept the tube extrusions to which i -booleanunion- to a hollowed cube<p>
			<p>After this I created the top cube by making the same tube extrusions, but 90mm long to keep with the rest of the design.</p>
			<p>Then added the Square frames along the side.</p>
			<h4>Printing the Lamps</h4>
			<p>This was my first time printing such large objects and I was suprised by how long it took.</p>
			<p>Tada, The finished Lamp!</p>

			<h3>The Mold</h3>
			<p>For this part of the assignment we had to create a mold for molds</p>
			<p>The Design i decided to try to go for was an mold for a mold for ice shot glasses.</p>
			<p>For the shot glasses I measured the dimensions of a shot glass, and created the geometry in rhino.</p>
			<p>I then split the glass in two for each side of the mold which i think i put on the  right side of the mold</p>
			<p>The idea is that I had to create kind of like a relief of the item so that it can properly form the mold, which then is used to create the ice shot glasses</p>
			<p>I think i still need to add keys and a hole for which water will be poured.</p>
			<p>I have yet to print them yet, because the lamp took so much longer than expected. So tune in next week to see how it turned out!</p>

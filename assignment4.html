            <h1>Assignment 4 - Getting Meshy! and Lamps!</h1>
            
			<p> Assignment 4 had us Playing with meshes, and starting on a design for our lamps.</p>
			<h3>Get Meshy</h3>
			<p>The First part of the assignment had us play with the meshes of STLs</p>
			<p>This part of the assignment was very intresting but time consuming.</p>
			<p>Playing with the STLs allowed me to create modifications to existing STLs</p>
			<p>For this assignment I joined a Mason Jar Spout <a href = "https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:275268">https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:275268</a> and a Peppa the Pig Toothpaste Extruder <a href = "https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2745536">https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2745536</a>. 
			<p>Initially I had to cut the top of the Mason Jar Spout and the bottom of Toothpaste Extruder so that I can later join the two.</p>
			<p>After this I had to algin the edges of the two the best I could to make the most seamless Join I could</p>
			<p>After this I used the Join and Weld Commands to make the verticies 1</p> 
			<p>Heres the finished Product</p>

			<h3>My Lamp</h3>
			<p>For this part of the assignment we had to create a nested object.</p>
			<p>The second Part of the assignment has us Starting Designs for a Lamp.</p>
			<p>The design I decided to do will end up looking like 3 cubes stacked on top of one another.</p>
			<p>To do this the center cube will have holes in in to hold the other two Cubes which will then attach with extendend rods.</p>
			<p>This will allow the top and bottom cubes to be modular, and changeable with other designs as long as the rods are in the correct places.</p>
			<p>Currently I have begun Modelling the Center cube, I have measured the Innards and Lightbulb to have them correctly fit into the lamp.</p>
			<p>Heres a sketch of the design for the lamp</p>
